## Title
EMPLOYEE TRACKER SQL

## Description
This command-line application allows users to manage their company's employees, departments, and roles with ease. Upon starting the application, users are presented with a set of options that include viewing all departments, roles, and employees, as well as adding new departments, roles, and employees, and updating an employee's role. Choosing to view all departments presents a formatted table of department names and ids, while choosing to view all roles shows the job title, role id, department, and salary for each role. Viewing all employees presents a formatted table of employee data, including their id, first and last name, job title, department, salary, and the manager they report to. Adding a department, role, or employee is a prompt-driven process that allows users to easily add new entries to the database. Finally, the option to update an employee's role allows users to select an employee and update their role in the database. With this application, managing employee information has never been easier. Additionally, the application comes with clear instructions on how to install, use, and test it to ensure its smooth operation.
